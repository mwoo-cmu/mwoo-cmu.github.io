            "intoTheUnknown": "INTO THE UNKNOWN: This Turning Point involves Characters entering a situation with unknown factors. To know the unknown, you have to commit to it. For instance, a magic portal where there is no way of knowing what’s on the other side except by walking through it. Or, you discover a machine that is very powerful but you have no idea what it does, except if you turn it on. The only way to discover the unknown is to engage it, when it will be too late if you regret it.",

            "collateralDamage": "COLLATERAL DAMAGE: Whatever is going on in this Turning Point, the activity will spill over from the focus of that activity to things around it. This is particularly true for damaging events. For instance, a superhero defeats a villain in a downtown brawl, but doing significant damage to the buildings around them in the process. The collateral damage does not have to be physical. For instance, it could be the legal fallout from a major court decision.",

For instance, a spy is forcing a diplomat to hand over technology secrets or he will expose the diplomat’s illegal activities and send him to jail.

This can be a decision made earlier in the Adventure, or it can be something from before the Adventure. This earlier decision may not have seemed like a bad one at the time, but it has turned out to be bad, either for the Character, for others, or both.

            "notWorking": "THIS ISN’T WORKING: Something that is supposed to be working is not for some reason, causing a problem.

Whatever isn’t working is something that was assumed would work.",

Whatever is happening, it should be something deeply embarrassing to the Character. For instance, a member of an unpopular community is being bullied and mocked, or a public figure has something personal publicly exposed.",
